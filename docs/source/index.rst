Welcome to ``rusttypes``'s documentation!
===========================================

   `Bring the power of Rust to Python! Kind of...`

``rusttypes`` is a Python 3 library that provides a set of utilities to write
Python code that is more Rust-like. This includes:

- A ``Result`` type that can be used to return either a value or an error.
- A ``Option`` type that can be used to return either a value or nothing.

It implements all the basic operations that you would expect from these types,
such as ``map``, ``and_then``, ``or_else``, etc.. At least as far as Python
allows it, and I was able to implement it. (:
